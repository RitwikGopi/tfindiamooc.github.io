title: "Week 3: Mathematical Foundations of DL and Data Pipelines with TF"
date: 2019-09-09
---
The Week# 3 of our course broadly covers:
* Review of Deep Learning (DL) concepts
* Mathematical foundations of DL
* Building data pipelines for TensorFlow 2.0

We review basic concepts of Deep Learning in [Lecture# 9[(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf9koajUwmo&list=PLOzRYVm0a65cTV_t0BYj-nV8VX_Me6Es3&index=9).
We begin with Neural Network representation of Linear and Logistic regression and from there go on to explain basic concepts of Deep Learning.

After explaining the basic concepts, we present a colab on mathematical foundations of Deep Learning.  Tensor is a basic data structure for 
storing data in memory during Deep Learning operations.  We cover basics of Tensor and fundamental mathematical operations on tensor that are 
commonly used in Deep Learning.

Later in the week, we will explore how to build data pipelines in TensorFlow 2.0 for variety of input formats like CSV, images and text.

Hope you enjoy learning TensorFlow 2.0 with us! Do let us know your feedback and ask questions on the course forum.
